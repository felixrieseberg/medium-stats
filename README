# Medium Stats

You have a Medium publication. You want to know where your readers find
your stories. Sadly, Medium only gives you that information per story,
but not in aggregate.

This little tool will give collect "referrer" statistics for your stories,
both individually and in aggregate. It will save them as CSV (for use with
Excel or Google Sheets) and as JSON.

To run the tool, pass it the URL to a `stats/stories` page.

To use with your personal Medium blog:
```sh
npx medium-stats https://medium.com/@felixrieseberg/stats
```

To use with a publication:
```sh
npx medium-stats https://slack.engineering/stats/stories
```

The tool will use a Chromium-based browser (either Chrome or Microsoft Edge)
installed on your computer to manually scrape statistics. When the browser
opens, please sign into your Medium account and let the tool navigate around.
